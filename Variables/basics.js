// We're going to earn a profit by reselling tickets
// We bought some tickets to see SZA!
// 4 regular tickets for $45 each and 2 front row tickets for $75 each

let cost = (45 * 4) + (75 * 2);
console.log('Cost: ' + cost);

// we're selling them for 50% more lol.
console.log('Selling price: ' + cost * 1.5);

// But StubHub, the online ticket selling platform, charges a 20% seller fee...
console.log('Seller fee: ' + cost * 1.5 * 0.2);

// So here's our total profit:
console.log('Total profit: ' + (cost * 1.5 - cost * 1.5 * 0.2));
